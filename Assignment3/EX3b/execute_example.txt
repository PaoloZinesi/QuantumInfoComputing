# allocate a 1000x1000 random Hermitian matrix, compute its eigenvalues and store the 
# normalized spacings in 'results/norm_spac.dat'
./a.out 1000


# multiple consecutive runs of 'a.out' will append the resulted
# spacings at the end of the 'results/norm_spac.dat', which will be used to gather
# eigenvalue statistics in exercise 3c
