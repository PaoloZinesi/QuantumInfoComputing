# create a 1000x1000 random Hermitian matrix, compute its eigenvalues and append the 
# normalized spacings in 'results/norm_spac_HS.dat'
./a.out 1000 HS


# create random real diagonal matrix and append the normalized spacings 
# in 'results/norm_spac_DS.dat'
./a.out 1000 DS

# multiple consecutive runs of 'a.out' will append the resulted
# spacings at the end of the relative file



# results are stored in files inside the folder 'results' (the 'results_example'
# folder contains an example of data and its plot)

# error messages in the execution are stored in 'errors.log' file

# when all the calculations are finished and stored into 'results',
# run the script 'EX3c_plots.py' to obtain the fitted plots in the same
# folder 'result'
