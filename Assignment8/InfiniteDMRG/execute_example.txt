./InfiniteDMRG.out 10000 16 input/lambda.dat input/eps.dat
# will find the energy density of the ground state of the system, 
# until the maximum number of iterations = 10000 is reached or the updates 
# of the energy goes below the threshold contained in "input/eps.dat".
# The value of lambda is contained in the file "input/lambda.dat".
# The evolution of the energy density over the iterations is saved into the file
# "results/spectra/spectrum_10000_16.dat" and the time needed for the computations 
# is appended to "results/timescalings.csv".


# pay attention run 'bash compile.sh' script only when previous results
# can be removed, since the script will remove every file in the folder 'results'

# error messages in the execution are stored in 'errors.log' file


# when all the calculations are finished and stored into 'results',
# run the python code "../RG_plots.pynb" to obtain the plots
