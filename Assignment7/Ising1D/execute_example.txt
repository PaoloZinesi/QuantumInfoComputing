./Ising1D 6 10 input/lambda.dat
# will create a (2**6,2**6) = (64,64) Hamiltonian and compute the 10 lowest 
# eigenvalues using the value of lambda stored into 'input/lambda.dat'.
# Results are stored in the folder "results".
# For machines with 8 GB of RAM, the maximum allowed N is 14.


# pay attention run 'bash compile.sh' script only when previous results
# can be removed, since the script will remove every file in the folder 'results'

# error messages in the execution are stored in 'errors.log' file


# when all the calculations are finished and stored into 'results',
# run the python code "Ex7_plots.ipynb" to obtain the plots
