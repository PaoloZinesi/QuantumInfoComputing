./fftw_test
# will create three files in the folder 'results', which can be plotted using 
# EX5_plots.ipynb notebook. In these output files the first row contains the grid
# on which the WF is defined, while the other rows contain the values of the WF
# (real and imaginary part are the two values that appear in each row).


./TD_HarmOsc_1D.out 100 input/omega.dat input/Ttot.dat input/init_WF.dat
# will evolve the wavefunction from t=0 to t=Ttot through 100 time steps,
# using the value of omega found
# in 'input/omega.dat', the value of Ttot found in 'input/Ttot.dat' and
# the initialization wavefunction found in 'input/init_WF.dat'.
# Results are created in the 'results' folder.


# pay attention run 'bash compile.sh' script only when previous results
# can be removed, since the script will remove every file in the folder 'results'

# error messages in the execution are stored in 'errors.log' file


# when all the calculations are finished and stored into 'results',
# run the python code "EX5_plots.ipynb" to obtain the plots
