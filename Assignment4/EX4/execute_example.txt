./a.out 10000 10 input/omega.dat results/out.dat
# will evaluate N=10000 function points of the 1D harmonic oscillator,
# find k=10 eigenvalues,
# take the value of omega from 'input/omega.dat' file and 
# write the results on 'results/out.dat'.


# pay attention run 'bash compile.sh' script only when previous results
# can be removed, since the script will remove every file in the folder 'results'

# error messages in the execution are stored in 'errors.log' file


# when all the calculations are finished and stored into 'results',
# run the python code "EX4_plots.ipynb" to obtain the plots
